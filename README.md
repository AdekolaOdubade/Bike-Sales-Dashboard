# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
This project presents an interactive Bike Sales Dashboard built using Excel. It provides insights into customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and commuting patterns that influence bike sales. The dashboard enables users to filter data dynamically by Marital Status, Region, and Education, making it easy to explore different customer segments.
### Dashboard Overview
- Average Income per Purchase by Gender – Compares the average income of customers who purchased bikes, segmented by gender.
- Customer Commute – Shows the distance customers travel to work and how it impacts bike purchases.
- Customer Age Bracket per Bike Purchased – Breaks down purchases by age groups: Adolescent, Middle Age, Old.
- Bike Purchases by Gender (Car Owners) – Highlights the correlation between car ownership, gender, and bike purchases.

### Insights
- Married individuals show higher bike purchasing trends compared to singles.
- Middle-aged customers are the largest group of bike buyers.
- Income levels directly influence bike purchase decisions, with males showing higher average income per purchase.
- Commute distance plays a role-customers within shorter commute ranges (0-1 mile) purchase bikes more frequently.
### Recommendations
1. Target Middle-Aged Customers
- They form the largest buyer group. Marketing campaigns and promotions should be designed around this age bracket.
2. Leverage Married Customer Segment
- Married individuals purchase more bikes compared to singles. Family-oriented offers (e.g., couple/family bike packages) could boost sales.
3. Income-Based Product Positioning
- Higher income customers show stronger purchase behavior. Premium bike models should be marketed towards high-income male buyers, while offering affordable entry models for lower income groups.
4. Commute-Friendly Bikes
- Most buyers have shorter commutes (0-5 miles). Promoting commuter-friendly, lightweight, and eco-friendly bikes will resonate with this audience.
5. Regional Marketing Focus
- Since the dashboard supports region-based filters, focus marketing in regions with higher purchasing rates (e.g., Europe or North America if trends show stronger adoption).
6. Education-Linked Campaigns
- Buyers with higher education levels tend to purchase more. Targeting professionals (graduate or bachelor’s degree holders) through LinkedIn ads or workplace campaigns may increase sales.
